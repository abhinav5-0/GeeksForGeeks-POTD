Got it! Here’s a nicely formatted **Markdown content** optimized for creating a Canva slide or poster for the **Longest Span in Two Binary Arrays** problem statement.

You can copy-paste this into Canva’s text boxes, or use it as a reference for your slide design:

# Longest Span in Two Binary Arrays

---

### Problem Statement

Given two binary arrays, **a1\[]** and **a2\[]**, find the length of the **longest common span (i, j)**, where `j >= i`, such that:

> Sum of elements in a1 from i to j = Sum of elements in a2 from i to j

Formally:

```
a1[i] + a1[i+1] + ... + a1[j] = a2[i] + a2[i+1] + ... + a2[j]
```

---

### Examples

**Example 1:**

* Input:
  `a1 = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  `a2 = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]`

* Output: `4`

* Explanation:
  The longest span with the same sum is from **index 1 to 4** (0-based indexing).

---

**Example 2:**

* Input:
  `a1 = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  `a2 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]`

* Output: `6`

* Explanation:
  The longest span with the same sum is from **index 1 to 6** (0-based indexing).

---

### Constraints

* `1 <= a1.size() = a2.size() <= 10^6`
* `0 <= a1[i], a2[i] <= 1`

---

### Key Idea

* Create a **difference array** `diff[i] = a1[i] - a2[i]`
* Find the **longest subarray** in `diff` with **sum = 0**

---

### Function Signature (C++)

```cpp
int longestCommonSum(vector<int>& a1, vector<int>& a2);
```

---

### Visual Idea for Canva

* Use two side-by-side arrays visual to show `a1` and `a2`
* Highlight the common span indices
* Show the difference array with prefix sums
* Add arrows or boxes emphasizing the longest span
