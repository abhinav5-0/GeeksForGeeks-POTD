### üß© Problem Statement

Given a sorted integer array `arr[]` and an integer `k`, determine if it is possible to split the array into one or more consecutive subsequences such that:

* Each subsequence consists of **consecutive integers** (each number is exactly one greater than the previous).
* Every subsequence has a **length of at least k**.

Return `true` if such a split is possible, otherwise return `false`.

---

### üß† Examples

**Input:**
`arr = [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5], k = 2`
**Output:**
`true`
**Explanation:**
Array can be split into three subsequences of length `k`: `[2,3]`, `[2,3]`, `[4,5]`.

**Input:**
`arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], k = 4`
**Output:**
`false`
**Explanation:**
It is impossible to split `arr` into consecutive increasing subsequences of length 4 or more.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Constraints

* 1 ‚â§ arr.size() ‚â§ 10^5
* 1 ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ 10^5
* 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ arr.size()

### üí° Approach

We can use a **hash map of min-heaps** to keep track of subsequences ending with specific numbers.

#### Steps:

1. Traverse through the array elements.
2. For each element `x`:

   * If there exists a subsequence ending with `x-1`, extend it by adding `x`.
   * Otherwise, start a new subsequence with `x`.
3. After processing all elements, check that all subsequences have a length ‚â• `k`.

This greedy approach ensures subsequences are extended in the optimal way to form valid consecutive groups.

### ‚úÖ Code Implementation (C++)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
  public:
    bool isPossible(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>> mp;
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (mp.find(num - 1) != mp.end() && !mp[num - 1].empty()) {
                int len = mp[num - 1].top();
                mp[num - 1].pop();
                mp[num].push(len + 1);
            } else {
                mp[num].push(1);
            }
        }

        // Validate all subsequences
        for (auto& [key, pq] : mp) {
            while (!pq.empty()) {
                if (pq.top() < k) return false;
                pq.pop();
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```

### üïí Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) ‚Äî due to heap operations per element.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n) ‚Äî for storing subsequences.
