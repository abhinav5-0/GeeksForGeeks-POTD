### üß© Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree with integer values. Your task is to select a subset of nodes such that the sum of their values is maximized, with the condition that no two selected nodes are directly connected ‚Äî that is, if a node is included in the subset, neither its parent nor its children can be included.

---

### üìò Examples
**Input:**  
`root = [11, 1, 2]`

**Output:**  
`11`

**Explanation:** The maximum sum is obtained by selecting the node 11.

---

**Input:**  
`root = [1, 2, 3, 4, N, 5, 6]`

**Output:**  
`16`

**Explanation:** The maximum sum is obtained by selecting the nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6, which are not directly connected. Their total sum is 16.

### üîí Constraints
```
1 ‚â§ number of nodes ‚â§ 10^4  
1 ‚â§ node.data ‚â§ 10^5
```

### üí° Approach
For each node, we have two choices:
1. **Include** the node ‚Üí cannot include its children.
2. **Exclude** the node ‚Üí may include or exclude its children (take the max for each).

We perform a **postorder traversal (left-right-root)** and compute:
- `include` = node value + sum of exclude values from its children
- `exclude` = max(include, exclude) for each child

Finally, return `max(include, exclude)` for the root.

### üß† Intuition
This is a **Dynamic Programming on Trees (Tree DP)** problem. Each subtree contributes two states: one when the node is included and one when it is excluded.

### ‚úÖ C++ Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    pair<int, int> solve(Node* root) {
        if (!root) return {0, 0};

        auto left = solve(root->left);
        auto right = solve(root->right);

        // Include current node
        int include = root->data + left.second + right.second;

        // Exclude current node
        int exclude = max(left.first, left.second) + max(right.first, right.second);

        return {include, exclude};
    }

    int getMaxSum(Node* root) {
        auto res = solve(root);
        return max(res.first, res.second);
    }
};
```

### üßÆ Example Walkthrough
**Input:** `[1, 2, 3, 4, N, 5, 6]`

| Node | Include | Exclude |
|------|----------|----------|
| 4 | 4 | 0 |
| 5 | 5 | 0 |
| 6 | 6 | 0 |
| 2 | 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 3 | 11 |
| 1 | 16 | 15 |

‚úÖ **Answer = 16**

### ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N) ‚Äî Each node visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H) ‚Äî Due to recursion stack (H = height of tree).

---

### üèÅ Key Takeaways
- Use **Tree DP** with pair-based state tracking.
- Distinguish between **include** and **exclude** states for every node.
- Efficient for large trees with up to 10‚Å¥ nodes.
